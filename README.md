7. 2018/9/7

 I felt frustrated when I knew I was assigned to the Data Foundation.I want to learn the knowledge about Business Analysis or Data Analysis. I want to learn more data science knowlege.I want to learn more knowledge to survive in the rapid change age.

 From slack, I knew that someone change their track after completing Data Foundation.
 
 So I began the learning of Data Foundation.But I felt I was too positive about my learning plan. I forgot to consider things from my school. I have been occupied by the course most of the day. Outside of class, I still need to do a lot of homework. Even so, I am still studying hard.
